 # Logistic Regression using Machine Learning 

🧠 Project Description

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end implementation of Logistic Regression, one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms used for classification problems.

The goal of this project is to understand how Logistic Regression works in practice — from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook named LogisticRegression.ipynb.

This project is ideal for:
Machine Learning beginners
Students learning supervised learning
Interview preparation
Academic and portfolio use

🎯 Problem Statement

To build a machine learning model that can predict a binary class outcome (such as Yes/No, 0/1, True/False) using Logistic Regression based on input features from a dataset.

🚀 Key Features

Data loading and inspection
Handling missing values (if any)
Feature selection and preprocessing
Train-test data splitting
Logistic Regression model training
Model evaluation using multiple metrics
Clear and interpretable results
